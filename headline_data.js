But look closer: 55% of those yards came on 'schemed open' throws where receivers had 3+ yards of separation. Ben Johnson turned a 21-3 halftime deficit into a 31-27 win not by asking Caleb to be Superman, but by exploiting Green Bay's safeties with motion and spacing. That is the difference between a 'Talented QB' and a 'Coached QB'.",
