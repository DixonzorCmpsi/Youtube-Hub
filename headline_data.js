    "summary_long": "What if I told you... that one of the greatest soccer teams in history... decided to destroy their own future on purpose? It sounds impossible. It sounds like a glitch in the system. But in the summer of twenty twenty-three... Barcelona handed over their most dangerous weapon to their biggest rival... for almost nothing. We are talking about Ousmane Dembele. For years... critics called him a mistake... but the numbers tell a different story. Since leaving Spain... he has transformed into a clinical machine... leading Paris Saint-Germain to three major trophies and winning the twenty twenty-five Ballon d'Or. How does a club... already drowning in over one point four billion dollars of debt... give away the best player in the world for a pittance? Tonight... we are going deep into the data. We are going to look at why Barcelona is struggling in Europe... even with a young star like Lamine Yamal on the pitch. You will see exactly how a single bad trade... can bankrupt a team's chances of winning for a decade. This is not just about a player moving teams... it is a masterclass in how to fail at the highest level. The stats are shocking... and they prove that Barcelona made the biggest mistake in sports history. Let’s get into it."

He ranked in the top one percent of all players for carrying the ball toward the goal. He had eight goals and nine assists... but his real value was how he forced the other team to defend him with two or three players at once. When Barcelona sold him... they didn't just lose a player... they lost the space he created for everyone else.",
